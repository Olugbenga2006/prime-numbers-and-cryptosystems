# Final Year Project


HOW TO RUN .

this could be easily run on your command line. 
all you need to do is compile the whole primality2 package at once using "javac primality2/*.java"


if you receive an error go into the primality2 folder and compile RSA first. "javac .\RSA.java" then repeat the previous step


once this is finished. you launch the chatserver class "java primality2.ChatServer"


then on another terminal only launch the chatclient class. you have to be in the same directory "java primality2.ChatClient"

then you can communicate on the client side and the server will receive your messages. you can also see the encrypted messages.


to break send a message "exit"
