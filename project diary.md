**PROJECT DIARY**

<ins>5/2/2025:


RSA class completed functionality:


•   implemented prime number generation using the bigintegers inbuilt function


•   tested each generated number and utilised them in RSA encryption


•   allowed encryption to work on both capital and non capital letters along with punctuation marks


commits:


• committed to the product folder all functions listed above


• deleted prime generation branch as workload was way too small for a whole branch

<ins>1-6/12/2024:

research made and code completed:

•   Researched and documented how rsa works


•   Researched fermats and miller-rabins primality tests


•   finished primality testing for up to 300 digits


commits:

• committed to the documents folder, how rsa works and primality tests.


• commited final primality testing
