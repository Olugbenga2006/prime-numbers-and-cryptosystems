**PROJECT DIARY**


<ins> 23/4/2025:


implemented all base functionality and finished cleaning up
created a GUI for both the classes CHatServer and Chatclient

commits:


• fixing readme and adding javadoc

Theres a large gap in the project as almost a fullmonth 
i delayed work due to sickness and privte problems. amd only recently continued the work 2 days ago. 
why i applied for the pseudo extensio


<ins> 19/3/2025:


diffie hellman key exchange protocol implemented


•   diffiehellmankeygenerator class to give a secret shared key between the client and the server.



commits:


• created diffiehellmankeygenerator class



<ins> 7/3/2025:


JAVA socket class which enables encrypted conversation between vlient and server:


•   simply created the two classes and link them together using a socket


•   had troubles compiling the code and therefore changed part of the classes which made the encryption fall apart


•   found out i had to compile certain files first before others so they could function. also a setter class for another logic error

commits:


• commited original ChatServer class and CHatClient class


• commit to fix previous mistakes and update to Readme to show how to run both classes properly


<ins>5/2/2025:


RSA class completed functionality:


•   implemented prime number generation using the bigintegers inbuilt function


•   tested each generated number and utilised them in RSA encryption


•   allowed encryption to work on both capital and non capital letters along with punctuation marks


commits:


• committed to the product folder all functions listed above


• deleted prime generation branch as workload was way too small for a whole branch

•   finished primality testing for up to 300 digits


commits:

• committed to the documents folder, how rsa works and primality tests.
